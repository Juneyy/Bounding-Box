# Transfer-Learning U-Net
A project on using Transfer Learning to segment lung pneumonia. 

## 1.0 Motivation
Segmentation is costly to annotate. Requires someone with a degree of training to go through each slice and carefully contour what you're looking for. Given the recent event of COVID, pneumonia is only present as a serious complication of the case. This project is motivated to help patients by using machine learning to detect pneumonia.
